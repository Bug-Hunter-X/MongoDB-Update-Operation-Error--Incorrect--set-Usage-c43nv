# MongoDB Update Operation Error: Incorrect $set Usage
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$set` operator in MongoDB update operations. The error occurs when attempting to update multiple fields using a single `$set` operator without properly handling cases where those fields may not exist in the document. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect data updates.

## Problem
The original code provides an example of how to incorrectly use the `$set` operator in a MongoDB update operation. This results in an update operation that only updates the fields that exist in the document. If one or more of the fields to be updated do not exist in the document, the update operation completes without raising any error. This can lead to unexpected data inconsistencies. 

## Solution
The solution demonstrates the correct way to use the `$set` operator, where the missing fields are handled in such a way that the update operation doesn't fail, even if the fields are absent in the document. This can be achieved by using $setOnInsert along with $set operator.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required MongoDB driver.
4. Replace the placeholder connection string in `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` with your actual MongoDB connection string.
5. Run `node bug.js` to see the incorrect behavior.
6. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected behavior.
